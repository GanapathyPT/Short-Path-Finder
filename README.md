# Short-Path-Finder
  -- Application to find short distance between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm

## Requirements
make sure python is installed on your computer
```bash
python --version
Python 3.6.9
```
install pygame module using pip (python package installer)
```bash
pip --version
pip 20.3.3
```
## usage
clone the project and change the directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GanapathyPT/Short-Path-Finder.git
```
```bash
cd ./Short-Path-Finder
```
now execute the main file using python
```bash
python main.py
```
## normal usage
use the file I generated without installing anything on your system
```bash
./Path-Finder
```
## Rules
 1. Click any block to make it as Start Block
 2. Click another block to make it as End Block
 3. Make the Barriers by dragging the block of codes <br/>
 (**note**: don't make the barriers such that there is no path between the start and end block) <br/>
 (**warning**: if you do so it will crash the program üôÅ yes that's a bug)
 4. Click on space once you done drawing the barriers
 5. wait untill the Algorithm finds the path
 6. Click on any button to start again
